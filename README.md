# PhD-Codes
This repository contains examples of codes I wrote during my PhD in Physics analysing molecular dynamics simulations.

I wrote these codes as I was teaching myself python and the pandas package, so they improve as they go along. 

The simulation files aree standard lists of atomic coordinates (.xyz files), outputted from EPSR simulations (see https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Empirical-Potential-Structure-Refinement.aspx).

Example short simulation files (only a few frames/iterations long, compared to the normal 10,000+) are also included.
